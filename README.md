# Python Prework

Overview
----------------
This repository contains prework materials for learning Python: Jupyter Notebooks that introduce core concepts and a few example Python scripts.

Repository structure
----------------
- `Prework1/`
  - `PreWork Python 101_Introduction to Python.ipynb` — Basics of Python: variables, data types, basic I/O
  - `PreWork Python 102_Control Flow & Data Structures.ipynb` — Control flow (`if`, `for`, `while`) and fundamental data structures (`list`, `tuple`, `dict`, `set`)
  - `PreWork Python 103_Functions.ipynb` — Functions, parameters, scope, and `lambda` expressions

- `Prework2/`
  - `algo_tests1.py` — Example script with algorithm tests and sample runs (runnable from command line)
  - `Algorithm Advanced.ipynb` — More advanced algorithm topics and exercises (sorting, searching, complexity analysis, etc.)
  - `Python 1, intro to strings & operation.ipynb` — String operations and common string methods

Python topics covered
----------------
This collection covers a broad set of foundational Python topics suitable for beginners and early intermediate learners:

- **Syntax & Basics:** variables, literals, expressions, basic input/output
- **Data Types & Structures:** numbers, strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- **Control Flow:** conditional statements, loops, comprehensions
- **Functions & Scope:** defining functions, arguments, return values, local vs global scope, lambda functions
- **File I/O:** reading from and writing to files (introduced in notebooks)
- **Error Handling:** try/except basics and common exceptions
- **Algorithms & Complexity:** simple algorithm implementations, sorting/searching, and basic complexity discussion
- **String Manipulation:** common string methods and formatting

How to run
----------------
- To run the Jupyter Notebooks:

  1. Install dependencies (example):

     pip install jupyter

  2. From the repository root run:

     jupyter notebook

  Open the `.ipynb` files in the browser interface.

- To run the example Python script from the command line:

```
python Prework2/algo_tests1.py
```

Requirements
----------------
- Python 3.8 or newer is recommended
- `jupyter` for running notebooks
